Digital Developers currently come in two flavors: Junior and Expert. The QAD version works with Juniors.

# Installation Instructions

To install:

1. Create a deployment folder 
2. Copy the initialization folder within it and rename it to initialization (if necessary. It may be called OOTB_Initialization or something like that).
3. Look in the initialization folder for a folder called Deploy tasks. It will contain a few .bat files.
4. Run _OOTB_001_Storage_Provider.bat. This will bring up a console application you can type 1 and press enter to validate providers.
5. On success you will see a list of supported storage providers. 
6. Run _OOTB_002_Recognition_Providers.bat. This will bring up a console application you can type 1 and press enter to validate providers.

It is now installed. 

# Playing with Digital Developer QAD

The QAD version is a quick POC that I released so you get a feeling for the application. The full application is a lot larger. 
This is just a taste of what is coming in the next few months.

For this version run "DEE_DEE_002_Try Out DEE_DEE_QAD.bat" which is located in the Deploy Tasks folder to play with it.
